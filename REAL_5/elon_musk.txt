Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for his key roles in Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter (which he rebranded as X). Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world; as of March 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be $330 billion USD.

Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada, whose citizenship he had inherited through his mother. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S. before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.

In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX and became its CEO and chief engineer. The company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. In 2004, Musk joined Tesla, Inc., as an early investor, and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has become a market leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence research, but left its board in 2018. In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a company focused on brain–computer interfaces, and in 2017 launched the Boring Company, which aims to develop tunnel transportation. Musk was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump's newly created DOGE.

Musk's political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories. His acquisition of Twitter (now X) was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. He has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties.

Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[33] Musk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[34] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service,[35][36] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime,[2] as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States.[37] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[38]

Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[39][40] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[41] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[42][43] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995.[44] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[45][46][47][48][49] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[50]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[51][52] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[47][45][53] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[54][35] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[53] In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.[55]

Elon Musk is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$330 billion as of March 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index,[439] and $359.5 billion according to Forbes,[440] primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.[441]

Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012,[442] around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020.[443] Describing himself as "cash poor",[444][445] a year later, he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion.[446]

Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[447][448] whose stated purpose is to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas, with an interest in human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy, and "safe artificial intelligence".[449] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation donated nearly half of its $25 million directly to Musk's OpenAI.[450][451] The foundation's assets reached $9.4 billion by the end of 2021, but it only dispensed $160 million to charities that year.[452]

The Musk Foundation has been criticized for its "self-serving"[452] donations to efforts close to Musk's family and companies,[453] as well as its low payout ratio.[452][454] In 2021, after Musk challenged World Food Programme director David Beasley to draft a plan to use money of Musk's that Beasley said could contribute to ending world hunger,[455][456] Musk instead donated the $6 billion in question to his own foundation even after Beasley's plan showed that the money could feed 42 million people for a year.
